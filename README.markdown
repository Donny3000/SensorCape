This is a C++ and Python library for interfacing with the SensorCape for BeagleBone Black. The SensorCape is a highly capable add-on for the BeagleBone that adds the following functionality:
+ 3-axis gyroscope
+ 3-axis accelerometer
+ 3-axis magnetometer (compass)
+ Ambient light sensor
+ Ambient temperature sensor
+ Non-contact temperature sensor
+ Humidity sensor
+ Pressure sensor (Detects altitude changes)
+ 38 kHz IR sensor (Interfaces with common consumer electronics)
+ 4 push-buttons
+ 4 user-configurable LED's
