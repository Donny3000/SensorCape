# SensorCape

This is the project repository for the SensorCape for BeagleBone Black.The SensorCape is a highly capable add-on for the BeagleBone that adds the following functionality:

+ 3-axis gyroscope
+ 3-axis accelerometer
+ 3-axis magnetometer (compass)
+ Ambient light sensor
+ Ambient temperature sensor
+ Non-contact temperature sensor
+ Humidity sensor
+ Pressure sensor (Detects altitude changes)
+ 38 kHz IR sensor (Interfaces with common consumer electronics)
+ 4 push-buttons
+ 4 user-configurable LED's 

The repository hosts both the hardware files and the software library that is used to interact with the onboard sensors. Visit the [project page](http://michaelhleonard.com/projects/SensorCape) for further information and documentation.

## Checking out a specific folder

Sicne 2012 it has been possible to check out a specific folder in a git repository. This means that if you would like to develop or use the software but don't need the hardware files you don't have to clone them to your local computer. See [this stack overflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/600079/is-there-any-way-to-clone-a-git-repositorys-sub-directory-only) for more info or [read this tutorial](http://jasonkarns.com/blog/subdirectory-checkouts-with-git-sparse-checkout/). You may also want to check out [the official documentation](http://schacon.github.io/git/git-read-tree.html#_sparse_checkout).

I would recommend just cloning the entire repository.
